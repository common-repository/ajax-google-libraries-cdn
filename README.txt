<br />
A number of the javascript libraries which we use in the WordPress sites are also hosted on Google's [AJAX Libraries API](http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlibs/).
This plugin allows your WordPress site to use the content distribution network side of Google's AJAX Library API, rather than serving these files from your WordPress local directly.

This provides numerous great performance benefits:

* Decreased Latencyd
* Increased parallelism
* Better caching
* HTTP compression with the requesting browser

After installation and activation of the plugin, automatically all the jQuery files listed below will load from the Google Ajax library.
